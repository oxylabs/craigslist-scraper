[<u>Craigslist
Scraper</u>](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/web/craigslist) is
a scraping tool that overcomes advanced anti-bot systems and helps you
gather public data from Craigslist on any scale you need. This guide
will show you how to scrape Craigslist using Oxylabsâ€™ [<u>Scraper
API</u>](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api).

## How it works

You can get Craigslist data by sending a request to our API with the
URLs you want to access and scrape. The API will return the HTML of any
public Craigslist page.

### Python code example

The below code sample sends a request to our service, which uses a
headless browser to execute JavaScript and sends back the HTML of a
Craigslist page:

```python
import requests
from pprint import pprint

# Structure payload.
payload = {
   'source': 'universal',
   'url': 'https://berlin.craigslist.org/search/ela#search=1~gallery~0~0',
   'geo_location': 'Germany',
   'render': 'html'
}

# Get a response.
response = requests.request(
    'POST',
    'https://realtime.oxylabs.io/v1/queries',
    auth=('USERNAME', 'PASSWORD'), #Your credentials go here
    json=payload
)

# Instead of response with job status and results URL, this will return the
# JSON response with results.
pprint(response.json())
```

Visit the
[<u>documentation</u>](https://developers.oxylabs.io/scraper-apis/web-scraper-api/all-domains)
to find more payload parameters and other details.

### Output sample

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "content": "<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>
      ...
      </script></body>\n</html>\n",
      "created_at": "2023-09-21 14:26:52",
      "updated_at": "2023-09-21 14:27:10",
      "page": 1,
      "url": "https://berlin.craigslist.org/search/ela#search=1~gallery~0~0",
      "job_id": "7110630468831163393",
      "status_code": 200
    }
  ]
}
```
